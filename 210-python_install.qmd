## OS Specific Installation Notes

{{< include installation/pyenv-mac.qmd >}}

{{< include installation/pyenv-windows.qmd >}}

{{< include installation/pyenv-linux.qmd >}}

## Install Python

{{< include installation/pyenv-install_python.qmd >}}

## Install Packages

We recommend that you try to keep your base python version as clean as possible,
i.e., do not install any packages into it.
Instead, please head over to the
[Virtual Environments page](320-python_virtual_environments.qmd)
page and install your packages into a virtual environment.
