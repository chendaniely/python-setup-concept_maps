title: Jupyter + Quarto
---

Many external Python
[IDEs](330-ide.qmd)
will require `jupyter` and/or the `ipykernel`.
If you are working in a
[Virtual Environment](320-python_virtual_environments.qmd),
you may need to both `jupyter` and `ipykernel` into your `venv` virtual environment.

::: {.callout-important}
It's important that you understand how virtual environments work in this context:

The `python`, `jupyter,`, `ipykernel`, etc that you use within a virtual environment,
__is__ the version that was installed in that environment.
When we call `python` or `python3` in the context of a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`),
_only_ the packages installed in that virtual environment will be detected.
This is a common issue to check if you end up with a `ModuleNotFoundError`,
when using other tools.

If you have packages you need from another environment,
you have to install them again in the environment you want to use them in as well.

## IDEs

The
[IDE](330-ide.qmd)
section covered how to make sure you are using the correct python interpreter or environment
so it can properly use IPython Kernel for Jupyter to run your Python code
with the packages you have installed in a particular environment.

## Quarto

Jupyter is one of the execution backend engines that
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
uses to execute code and capture its output.
You can get started with Quarto by installing it here:
<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.

Quarto has a series of
[Guides](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) as well to help with
different outputs.
Specifically,
there is a
[Using Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)
guide in the
[Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

Quarto documents have a YAML header that specifies various option keys
of the current document.
One of the more important options when working with Python + Quarto
is to set the `jupyter` as a top-level key to the `python3` value.

```{.yaml}
---
title: "Example Quarto Document"
format: html
jupyter: python3
---
```

The `jupyter: python3` option tells Quarto that when it uses `python3`
to run the python code,
it is the current `python3` in the environment Quarto was called in.

::: {.callout-note}
When rendering a quarto document,
it's important to check which environment `python3` will be running in.
You should be running `quarto`
(e.g., `quarto render` or `quarto preview`)
in the same
[virtual environment](320-python_virtual_environments.qmd)
as your project.
